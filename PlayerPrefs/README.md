NS.PlayerPrefs makes it easy to save/load other variable types other than the default PlayerPrefs types.

Instead of being confined to string, int, and float;
NS.PlayerPrefs will do the translation work for you, allowing you to save/load the following types:
- Vector2
- Vector3
- Quaternion
- Boolean
- Color
- String Array
- Int Array
- Float Array
- Boolean Array

Alongside the 3 default ones.
