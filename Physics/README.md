NS.Physics.OverlapCapsule is an updated Physics.OverlapCapsule.

Physics.OverlapCapsule will by default catch anything it touches/within itself.
NS.Physics.OverlapCapsule will catch anything within itself that is within line of sight. It will not catch an object which is behind another object. (I.E the table in the other room behind the wall.)
